## 2026-10-04

- Change: Reworked `approval_center` from an action-first prototype into an
  Approval Types workflow with field rules, seeded default types, dashboard
  request cards, multiple approvers, duplicate-approver protection,
  employee-manager approval, minimum approval defaulting to 1, and hidden
  technical action plumbing.
- Change: Added horizontal Approval Type field-rule controls and an Archived
  filter in the Approval Types configuration list.
- Change: Filtered already-selected approvers out of the approver dropdown on
  Approval Type and Approval Request forms.
- Change: Approval Request forms now materialize Approval Type configuration:
  configured approvers load when the request opens or the category changes, and
  request fields appear only when the type marks them required or optional.
- Fix: Approval Request Period now renders From and To on one aligned row so
  later fields such as Location do not slip into the period block.
- Fix: Approval Request users can now create/update/delete approver lines on
  their own requests, while Approval Type approver configuration remains
  administrator-controlled. Approvers can update their own approver line status.
- Fix: Submitted approval requests now notify approvers through Odoo's
  notification engine in addition to scheduling review activities.
- Fix: Review activities now set a visible Summary so the My Activities list
  shows the approval request prompt instead of an empty summary column.
- Fix: Restored Approval Center review activity completion with
  `activity_feedback()` on approve/refuse/cancel.
- Fix: User deletion with Calendar installed now removes the deleted user's
  `calendar.user` memberships with `sudo()`, because Odoo Calendar's
  `res.users.unlink()` cleanup was failing for users allowed to delete
  `res.users` but not allowed to delete another user's calendar membership.
- Reason: Match the researched Odoo Approvals user model and keep target
  model/action details out of the requester experience.
- Affected areas: `approval_center` models, views, access rules, tests, and Odoo
  verification references.
- Migration/compatibility notes: New module was still in foundation stage.
  Databases that installed the earlier prototype should upgrade before real use.

- Change: Added the `approval_center` module foundation with approval requests,
  policies, audit logs, security groups, backend views, module identity, and a
  custom icon.
- Reason: Start the real Approval Center module using the researched Odoo
  approval model: project policy and audit first, execution through app-specific
  Odoo actions.
- Affected areas: `approval_center`, approval governance docs, Odoo verification
  references.
- Migration/compatibility notes: New module only. Full database-backed install
  validation still requires PostgreSQL availability.

- Change: Updated authentication branding states, shared auth footer, public
  auth `v` query alias, AI Home Favorites star visibility, and AI Home card
  hover/focus styling.
- Reason: Match requested UX for reset-password, magic-link confirmation,
  authentication footer/privacy visibility, and AI Home interaction states.
- Affected areas: `branding`, `auth_magic_link` inherited auth shell,
  `auth_signup` inherited reset-password page, `web` inherited login page, and
  `ai_home` dashboard UI.
- Migration/compatibility notes: Uses Odoo 20 QWeb inheritance and the existing
  standalone auth shell. Full database-backed module validation still requires
  PostgreSQL availability.
